      // Dragons 🐉 have been reintroduced into the client, but hear us out:
      // Web3.js mutates the ethereum object, and this causes an issue when
      // connecting to a local chain, as for some reason the send method stops
      // working properly and can't get the chainId. This causes use-wallet
      // and subsequently web3-react to fail. A solution we found was cloning
      // the ethereum object before it can be mutated, and passing that to
      // use-wallet.
